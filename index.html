      <p>I'm currently a student at Founders and Coders, an incredible peer-led coding bootcamp. I had my first experience of coding whilst studying Maths at university - I used R to create a statistical model investigating the evolution of altruism. It engaged me, intruiged me and drove me crazy all at the same time. Since then, I've gone on many different journeys and have ultimately come back to tech. There are a lot of things in the world that I'm passionate about changing, and I think that tech is the way I can have the biggest impact as well as the most personal growth and satisfaction. I'm looking for a role where I can start having a positive impact on the world, whether big or small.
